* User1 takes 1 ticket
* User1 need to create new branch immediately
* User1 runs Import2PowerPlatform
* User1 develops in PowerApps
* User1 runs Export_1 and Export_2

Notes:
* Import2PowerPlatform could take over the branch creation, however, how about the branch name? The user need to define the name manually
* Export_1 and Export_2 cannot be combined, because git somehow cannot find the folder even after re-checkout, see export_workflow.yml
